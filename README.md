1. Understanding the Problem Statement

In this phase, the project team comprehensively understands the problem statement, defining goals, constraints, and success criteria.

    Objective: Clearly define the problem to be solved.
    Tasks:
        Conduct stakeholder meetings.
        Define project scope and objectives.
        Identify success criteria.

2. Data Collection

Accumulate relevant data sources to address the defined problem. This involves sourcing, acquiring, and organizing the data for analysis.

    Objective: Collect diverse and representative data.
    Tasks:
        Identify data sources.
        Establish data collection mechanisms.
        Gather and organize raw data.

3. Data Checks to Perform

Before proceeding with analysis, perform necessary data checks to ensure quality, completeness, and consistency.

    Objective: Ensure data quality and integrity.
    Tasks:
        Check for missing values.
        Identify and handle outliers.
        Validate data formats.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns, relationships, or potential challenges.

    Objective: Understand data characteristics.
    Tasks:
        Visualize data distributions.
        Explore correlations between variables.
        Identify potential feature engineering opportunities.

5. Data Pre-Processing

Prepare the data for model training by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

    Objective: Ensure data is suitable for model training.
    Tasks:
        Impute missing values.
        Encode categorical variables.
        Scale numerical features.

6. Model Training

Train and evaluate machine learning models using the prepared data, iterating as needed to achieve optimal performance.

    Objective: Develop and assess predictive models.
    Tasks:
        Split data into training and validation sets.
        Train various models.
        Evaluate model performance.

7. Choose Best Model

Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and deploy it for solving the problem at hand.

    Objective: Choose a model that meets project objectives.
    Tasks:
        Compare model performances.
        Select the best model.
        Deploy the chosen model for production use.
